## Introduction

Python offers several ways to perform input and output operations, whether you need to interact with users, read/write files, or handle errors gracefully. This guide will walk you through the basics of Python I/O.

## Reading Input

Python provides various functions for reading input from the user:

### `input()`

The `input()` function reads a line of text from the user and returns it as a string.

```python
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + user_input + "!")
Writing Output
Python supports multiple ways to display output:

print()
The print() function is used to display text or variables to the console.

print("Hello, World!")
File I/O
Python allows you to read from and write to files using the built-in file handling functions.

Opening a File
To open a file for reading or writing, you can use the open() function.


# Opening a file for reading
file = open("example.txt", "r")

# Opening a file for writing
file = open("output.txt", "w")
Reading from a File
You can read the contents of a file using various methods like read(), readline(), or readlines().


# Read the entire file
content = file.read()

# Read one line at a time
line = file.readline()
Writing to a File
To write data to a file, you can use the write() method.


file.write("This is a line of text.")
Closing a File
Always close a file when you're done with it using the close() method.


file.close()
Error Handling
Python allows you to handle errors using try-except blocks. This ensures your program doesn't crash when an exception occurs.

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Handle the exception here
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))
